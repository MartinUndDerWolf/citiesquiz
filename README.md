# CitiesQuiz

[Demo](https://martinschumann.cool)

This is the implementation of a small game, which was created in less then 8h. It also shows the usage of the GoogleMaps JavaScript API with the help of [AGM - Angular Google Maps](https://angular-maps.com/).
The site was tested on the following platforms:

4. iPhone
  * iOS 11.2.6
5. Windows

### Explain how you would store the high score

With a REST server the high score could be saved on the server. A page could be added to display a ranking. For the ranking a user name must be provided by the user.

### Explain what you would do better

1. More feedback.
  * If the placement was successful/unsuccessful.
  * If the game is over.
  * Dialog for user interaction after placement was set (next).
2. Error messages.
3. Some animation for the GUI. 
4. Store the cities.json on the server and retrieve lat/lng automatically.
5. REST Server to store the high score and other stuff.
6. Replace Google Maps API with custom implementation for offline usage.
7. Ranking page.
8. Add preview of all cities.
9. Extend list of cities. Add other geographic locations (lakes, rivers, mountains ...)
10. Input of a user name, if the user reached a high score.

[Demo](https://martinschumann.cool)

This is the implementation of a small game, which was created in less then 8h. It also shows the usage of the GoogleMaps JavaScript API with the help of [AGM - Angular Google Maps](https://angular-maps.com/).

### Explain how you would store the high score

With a REST server the high score could be saved on the server. A page could be added to display a ranking. For the ranking a user name must be provided by the user.

### Explain what you would do better

- More feedback.
  - If the placement was successful/unsuccessful.
  - If the game is over.
  - Dialog for user interaction after placement was set (next).
- Error messages.
- Some animation for the GUI. 
- Store the cities.json on the server and retrieve lat/lng automatically.
- REST Server to store the high score and other stuff.
- Replace Google Maps API with custom implementation for offline usage.
- Ranking page.
- Add preview of all cities.
- Extend list of cities. Add other geographic locations (lakes, rivers, mountains ...)
- Input of a user name, if the user reached a high score.
